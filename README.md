# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning (Python)

## 1. project Overview

This project  focuses on developing a "House Price Prediction system" using "Machine Learning techniques" in "Python", implemented and documented entirely within "Jupyter Notebooks".

The objective is to analyze a real-world housing dataset, perform data preprocessing, apply multiple machine learning algorithms, evaluate their performance, and compare results to identify the most effective predictive model.

The dataset used in this assignment is sourced from Kaggle, ensuring realism and academic relevance.

## 2. Dataset Description

-   Dataset Name: Bengaluru House Price Prediction Dataset\
-   Source: Kaggle
-   Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/house-prediction-dataset

This dataset primarily contains Bengaluru (Bangalore) house price data, widely used for regression-based machine learning tasks. It includes housing-related attributes such as: Area type and location (Bengaluru regions), Property size and total square footage, Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and balconies. Other numerical and categorical features influencing house prices.

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is directly loaded into the Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model development.
